## LUKSO L16 - FAQ

### NETWORK

#### What will be the expected block and epoch time?
```
```

#### What is the expected tx/second?
```
```

#### Are there any changes on the LUKSO network compared to Ethereum 2.0? What are those changes?
```
```

#### Will other clients be supported besides geth (in the same way as Ethereum)?
```
```

#### What is Luksoâ€™s vision regarding the network? Will Lukso keep following the Ethereum network updates or eventually split and follow its own path again after mainnet with the Pandora/Vanguard/Orchestrator clients?

```
```

#### Can I stake my tokens without being a validator?
```
```

#### Is LUKSO going to implement the EIP-1559 protocol?
```
```

#### Are there any other protocols LUKSO wants to implement on mainnet?
```
```

### NODE

#### How can I set up a node?
```
```

#### Will lower latency positively influence my rewards?

```
```

#### How to setup my node to maximize my peers?
```
```

#### Why is there a difference between my peers on the execution stats and consensus stats website?
```
```

#### What ports must be open on a node?

It would be best if you opened the following ports and protocols in the network to run your node correctly.

```
tcp:30303
tcp:8545
tcp:8598
tcp:8080
tcp:3500
tcp:4000
tcp:13000
udp:12000
udp:30303
```
##### How can I open my ports on my node machine? Can you describe it for Mac and Linux
```
```

:::info
NOTE: Make sure you also forward those ports in your router.

### VALIDATOR

#### Can we confirm 1 validator = 32 LYX on mainnet?
```
```

#### When will it be possible to withdraw your LYX from your validator and how?
```
```

#### Is there a minimum of validators you need to run?
```
```

#### Is there a maximum limit on how many validators one node can run, regarding decentralization?
```
```

#### Is there an advantage to splitting validators across multiple nodes instead of running all validators on one node?
Example: One node with 200 validators or two nodes with 100 validators each.
```
```

#### What happens when a validator drops below 32 LYX?
```
```

#### Do you receive higher returns If you deposit more than 32 LYX in a validator?
```
```

#### Can I start extra validators with the rewards I'm getting on my validator balance?
```
```

#### How should the logs look in each case to have certainty everything runs smoothly?
```
```
#### What is best practice in terms of performance, how to optimize my returns?
```
```

#### Is it possible to check if your validator is running correctly and what the rewards are without using Grafana/Prometheus?
```
```

#### Can you tell us something about the expected rewards APY curve?

Can we assume it will follow the same trend as ETH?

```
```

#### How much am I penalized for being offline?
```
```

### SECURITY

#### Is there a guide for node security best practices?
```
```

#### Can my node location be tracked?
``` 
```

#### Is it possible for someone to see how many validators are running on my node?
```
```

#### Why do we need to forward ports? Are there security risks?
```
