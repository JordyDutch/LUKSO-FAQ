## LUKSO l16 - FAQ

### NETWORK

#### What will be the expected block and epoch time?
```
```

#### What is the expected tx/second?
```
```

#### Are there any changes on the LUKSO network compared to Ethereum 2.0? What are those changes?
```
```

#### Will there be other supported clients besides geth as ethereum does it?
```
```

#### What's Lukso's vision regarding the network? Will Lukso keep following the Ethereum network updates or wil it eventually split and follow it's own path again after mainnet?
```
```


#### Will it be possible to stake your coins without running a validator?
```
```

### NODE

#### How can I set up the node?
```
```

#### Is there anything I need to be aware of besides the machine?
```
```

#### Does a low ping positively influence your rewards because you validate transactions faster?

```
```

#### How to setup my node to maximalise my peers?
```
```

#### What ports must be open on a node?

It would be best if you opened the following ports and protocols in the network to run your node correctly.

```
tcp:30303
tcp:8545
tcp:8598
tcp:8080
tcp:3500
tcp:4000
tcp:13000
udp:12000
udp:30303
```

### VALIDATOR

#### Can we call it confirmed that 1 validator = 32 LYX on mainnet?
```
```

#### Are the tokens locked for a certain amount of time?
```
```

#### Is it possible to be a validator for a period shorter than 12 months?
```
```

#### How many tokens do I have to deposit, is there a minimum of validators you need to run?
```
```

#### Is there a maximum of how many validators are alowed to be runned by 1 person, regarding decentralization?
```
```

#### Is there any difference in performance and returns running multiple validators in 1 or in 2  nodes? 
Example: 1 node with 200 validators or 2 nodes with 100 validators each.
```
```

#### What happens when a validator drops below 32 LYX?
```
```

#### Is there a difference between creating one validator with lots of funds and multiple validators with minimal/split funds?
```
```

#### Can I start extra validators with the rewards I'm getting on my validator balance?
```
```

#### How should the logs look in each case to have certainty everything runs smoothly?
```
```
#### What is best practice in terms of performance, how to optimise my returns?
```
```

#### When will it be possible to withdrawal your LYX from your validator and how?

```
```

#### Is it possible to check if your validator is running well and what the rewards are without using Grafana/Prometheus?
```
```

#### What can you tell us already something about the expected returns?

Like is it logical to assume it will follow the same trend as ETH. Does a high APY just create incentive for more people to stake and, in turn, lower the APY?

```
```

#### What is the slash for being offline for X hours?
```
```

#### Will slashes be depending on the amount of funds or depending purely on offline time?

### SECURITY

#### What is best practice in terms of node security. What measures to take?
```
```

#### Is it possible to track the location where a node is based?
``` 
```

#### Is it possible to tell how many validators are running on a node?
```
```

#### Why do we need to forward ports and what are the security risks of opening them?
```
